Today I was struggling with Jenkins CI, and I was unable to find _any_ documentation for `archiveArtifacts` function.
Just in case, if you have the same problems, check out this [link](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-37322?focusedCommentId=315065&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-315065)
