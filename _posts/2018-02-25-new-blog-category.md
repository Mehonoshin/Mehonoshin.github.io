Today I decided to introduce a couple of new blog categories, to make my blog posting more regular and frequent.
Meet `TIL` and `Book` categories.

I'll try to write daily about some useful things, that I learned, or at least a couple of techincal thoughts after work-day.

The second category is the summary of read books. I decided to introduce this category, because I realize, that in several months after reading I remember only few things from the book.
Hopefully this activity will help me.
